# Traffic

Experimenting with traffic simulations using [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and [Copilot](https://copilot-language.github.io/).

## Build and execute

To build `traffic`, just use

`cabal build`

To run the executable, use

`cabal exec traffic`

To see what would happen in the first `4` iterations, you could run

`cabal exec traffic -- -i4`
